# RTOS Scheduling Project
## Introduction
The goal of this project is to implement a FTP scheduler and to apply the Audsley scheduling algorithm. 

Therefore we can divide the project into 3 main parts :

1. The scheduler part : given a ordered list of tasks, we have to compute the scheduling of this tasks for a bounded period of time
2. The Audsley algorithm : given a list of tasks, we have to find an ordering of the task according to the Audsley algorithm that we will detail in the report and in the documentation of the audsley.py file
3. A visualisator tool : given a computed scheduling created at part 1, we must be able to see the scheduling in a gantt diagram
